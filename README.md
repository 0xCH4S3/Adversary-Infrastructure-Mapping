# What is Infrastructure Hunting?
Infrastructure Hunting is a relatively new concept in Cyber Security and we believe that in the current marketplace, there is a large focus solely on the ingestion and collection of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs). These are low-level historical artifacts from incidents that have occurred within victim environments.

Microsoft describes IOCs as:
"An indicator of compromise (IOC) is evidence that someone may have breached an organization’s network or endpoint. This forensic data doesn’t just indicate a potential threat, it signals that an attack, such as malware, compromised credentials, or data exfiltration, has already occurred. Security professionals search for IOCs on event logs, extended detection and response (XDR) solutions, and security information and event management (SIEM) solutions. During an attack, the team uses IOCs to eliminate the threat and mitigate damage. After recovery, IOCs help an organization better understand what happened, so the organization’s security team can strengthen security and reduce the risk of another similar incident."
